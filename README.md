[ohun](https://github.com/maRce10/ohun) is intended to facilitate the analysis of the structure of animal acoustic signals in R. Users can collect open-access avian recordings or enter their own data into a workflow that facilitates spectrographic visualization and measurement of acoustic parameters. [warbleR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=warbleR) makes use of the fundamental sound analysis tools of the seewave package, and offers new tools for acoustic structure analysis. These tools are available for batch analysis of acoustic signals.

The main features of the package are:

 - The use of loops to apply tasks through acoustic signals referenced in a selection table
 - The production of images in the working directory with spectrograms to allow users organize data and verify acoustic analyses

The package offers functions to:
 - Explore and download Xeno ‚Äê Canto recordings
 - Explore, organize and manipulate multiple sound files
 - Detect signals automatically (in frequency and time)
 - Create spectrograms of complete recordings or individual signals
 - Run different measures of acoustic signal structure
 - Evaluate the performance of measurement methods
 - Catalog signals
 - Characterize different structural levels in acoustic signals
 - Statistical analysis of duet coordination
 - Consolidate databases and annotation tables

Most of the functions allow the parallelization of tasks, which distributes the tasks among several processors to improve computational efficiency. Tools to evaluate the performance of the analysis at each step are also available. In addition, warbleR satisfies the need for rigorous open source bioacoustic analysis, which facilitates opportunities for use in research and innovation of additional custom analyzes.

Install/load the package from CRAN as follows:

```r
install.packages("warbleR")

#load package
library(warbleR)

```

To install the latest developmental version from [github](https://github.com/) you will need the R package [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools):

```r
devtools::install_github("maRce10/warbleR")

#load package
library(warbleR)

```
