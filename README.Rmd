[ohun](https://github.com/maRce10/ohun) is intended to facilitate the automatic detection of acoustic signals, providing functions to diagnose and optimize detection routines. Detections from other software can also be explored and optimized.

The main features of the package are:
 
   - The use of reference annotations for detection optimization and diagnostic 
   - The use of signal detection theory indices to evaluate detection performance 
   - Batch processing of sound files for improving computational performance
   
The package offers functions for:

   - Diagnose detection performance
   - Optimize detection routines based on reference annotations
   - Energy-based detection
   - Template-based detection
   
All functions allow the parallelization of tasks, which distributes the tasks among several processors to improve computational efficiency. The package works on sound files in '.wav', '.mp3', '.flac' and '.wac' format.


To install the latest developmental version from [github](https://github.com/) you will need the R package [remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("maRce10/ohun")

#load package
library(ohun)

```
